Expressive CSS is not intended to be a library or framework, but rather a presentation of an approach to writing lightweight, scalable CSS using utility classes that are easy to write and understand.

For more info, go to the [Expressive CSS Project Page](http://johnpolacek.github.io/expressive-css/).

To install:  
```npm install expressive-css```

This project uses npm as its build tool, which is used to process the SASS files via [node-sass CLI](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#command-line-interface). To build the project:  
```npm run build```

Or, to build the project with every save:  
```npm run watch```

This project contains some useful SASS mixins, such as utility generators. Check them out in the [css/sass/_mixins directory](https://github.com/johnpolacek/expressive-css/tree/master/css/sass/_mixins).

If you like the responsive grid system, check out the [Simple Grid](https://github.com/johnpolacek/simple-grid) and [Simple Grid Generator](https://github.com/johnpolacek/simple-grid-generator).
